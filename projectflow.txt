1. cloned repo to local
2. make and use mycode.py(to create a csv file and save in data folder)
3. git add commit push
# pip install dvc
4. dvc init(makes .dvc andm .dvcignore)
5. make a S3 directory ( liek importing data from s3 from AWS)
6. "dvc remote add -d myremote S3"(S3 url instead od S3 , myremote is the name) output : Setting 'myremote' as a default remote.
7. Next "dvc add data/" (we tell it to track changes in the data folder)(throws error as file is tracked my git)
