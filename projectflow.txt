1. cloned repo to local
2. make and use mycode.py(to create a csv file and save in data folder)
3. git add commit push
# pip install dvc
4. dvc init(makes .dvc andm .dvcignore)
5. make a S3 directory ( liek importing data from s3 from AWS)
6. "dvc remote add -d myremote S3"(S3 url instead od S3 , myremote is the name) output : Setting 'myremote' as a default remote.
7. Next "dvc add data/" 
   Now it will ask to do: ("git rm -r --cached 'data'" and "git commit -m "stop tracking data"")
   Because initially we were tracking data/ folder from git so now we remove it for DVC to handle.
8. Again we do "dvc add data/" (creates data.dvc) then "git add .gitignore data.dvc"
9. Now - "dvc commit" and then "dvc push"
10. Do a git add-commit-push to mark this stage as first version of data.
11. Now make changes to mycode.py to append a new row in data, check changes via "dvc status"
12. Again - - "dvc commit" and then "dvc push"
13. Then git add-commit-push (we're saving V2 of our data at this point)
14. Check dvc/git status, everything should be upto date.
15. Now repeat step 11-13 for v3 of data.
